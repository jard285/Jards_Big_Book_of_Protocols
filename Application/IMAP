Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)

Port: 143, 993 (IMAPS)
Protocol stack: TCP/IP

Used to retrieve emails from mail server, along with competetor POP3
Two-Way communcation, only headers are downloaded, content stays on page
Client command begins operation, each client commant is prefixed with a string, called a tag.  Commands are prefixed with '+' if they require a response
server can either respond to a command, (has same tag as client message), or send message unilaterally (using * as a tag, and refgerred to as untagged)

Command Types:
    Any State:      The following commands are valid in any state
        CAPABILITY: The CAPABILITY command requests a listing of capabilities that the
        NOOP:       The NOOP command always succeeds.  It does nothing.
        LOGOUT:     The LOGOUT command informs the server that the client is done with the connection

    Not Authenticated: In the not authenticated state, the AUTHENTICATE or LOGIN command establishes authentication and enters the authenticated state
        STARTTLS:       Indicates that the client will be using TLS to encrypt messages
        AUTHENTICATE:   The AUTHENTICATE command indicates a SASL authentication mechanism to the server. 
                        Server performs an authentication protocol exchange to authenticate and identify the client
        LOGIN:          The LOGIN command identifies the client to the server and carries the plaintext password authenticating this user.

    Authenticated: In the authenticated state, commands that manipulate mailboxes as atomic entities are permitted
        SELECT:         Selects a mailbox so that messages in the mailbox can be accessed
        EXAMINE:        identical to SELECT and returns the same output; but, selected mailbox is read-only
        CREATE:         The CREATE command creates a mailbox with the given name
        DELETE:         permanently removes the mailbox with the given name
        RENAME:         Changes the name of a mailbox
        SUBSCRIBE:      adds the specified mailbox name to the server's set of "active" or "subscribed" mailboxes returned by LSUB command
        UNSUBSCRIBE:    removes mailbox from server's active or subsribed mailboxes
        LIST:           returns a subset of names from the complete set of all names available to the client
        LSUB:           returns a subset of names from the set of names that the user has declared as being "active" or "subscribed"
        STATUS:         Requests the status of the indicated mailbox
                            fields: messages, recent, uidnext, uidvalidity, unseen
        APPEND:         command appends the literal argument as a new message to the end of the specified destination mailbox

    Selected: In the selected state, commands that manipulate messages in a mailbox are permitted

        CHECK:      requests a checkpoint of the currently selected
                    mailbox.  A checkpoint refers to any implementation-dependent housekeeping associated with the mailbox 
                    (e.g., resolving the server's in-memory state of the mailbox with the state on its disk)
        CLOSE:      permanently removes all messages that have the \Deleted flag set from the 
                    currently selected mailbox, and returns to the authenticated state from the selected state
        EXPUNGE:    permanently removes all messages that have the \Deleted flag set from the currently selected mailbox
        SEARCH:     searches the mailbox for messages that match the given searching criteria
        FETCH:      retrieves data associated with a message in the mailbox
        STORE:      alters data associated with a message in the mailbox.  Normally, STORE will return the updated value of the 
                    data with an untagged FETCH response
        COPY:       copies the specified message(s) to the end of the specified destination mailbox.  The flags and internal date of the
                    message(s) SHOULD be preserved, and the Recent flag SHOULD be set, in the copy
        UID:        In the first form, it takes as its arguments a COPY, FETCH, or STORE command with arguments appropriate for the associated command
                    the UID command takes a SEARCH command with SEARCH command argument
Flags:
    \Seen
       Message has been read

    \Answered
       Message has been answered

    \Flagged
       Message is "flagged" for urgent/special attention

    \Deleted

    \Draft
