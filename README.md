# Jards_Big_Book_of_Protocols

Jard's Big Book of Protocols is a collection of notes on common network protocols. This does not serve as a complete guide on the protcols. If you would like a complete description of the protocols I would recommend reading the RFCs.  RFCs for the each layer are held in a file called RFCs.  This collection of notes is meant to serve as a reference for quick information on packet structure, handshakes, and high-level explanations of the protocols.  Useful for having a copy of protocols when working on a device that is not connected to the internet, or as a compilation of common protocols in one place.
