Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

Port: 25 (between mail servers)/587 (mail clients)
Protocol Stack: TCP/IP


Mail Processing Flow:
Mail User Agent (MUA) ----> Mail Server Agent (MSA) ----> Mail Tranfer Agent (MTA)
MTA ----> DNS ----> Mail Exchange (MX) ----> Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) ----> 
storage/other network

Email submitted by MUA, sent to MSA using SMTP. MSA sends to MTA, Usually same instance
	of code runnning on one machine with different options.  MTA sends a DNS request
	to look up mail exchanger record for recipient domain and sends it to the mail
	exchanger using SMTP.  MTA can forward directly to another MTA or can make hops
	to relay (stores and forwards) or gateway (forward not using SMTP).  Once mail
	makes final hop, goes to MDA.  MDA places it in correct mailbox format. Can
	be one or many recipients.  Once MDA gets the message it can either send
	directly to storage or forward to another network through SMTP or LMTP. Once delivered
	to local mail server, mail is stored for batch retrieval by MUAs.  Mail is retrieved
	my email clients using either IMAP or
