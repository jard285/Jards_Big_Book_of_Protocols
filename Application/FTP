FTP: File Transfer Protocol

Port: 20 (default/data), 21 (control/command)
Protocol Stack: TCP/IP
FTP does not have a header

FTP src port random, dst either 20 or 21 if in control mode

FTP sends command instructions over port 21, recieves authorization, server responds with data over port 20.  Keeps port 21 open for additional commands

Active vs Passive: refers to how data connection is established 
    Active: No firewall, sends PORT command, FTP creates channel from port 20 for data
    Passive: Control connection if behind firewall, send PASV command, recieves IP addr and Port.

Modes of Data Representation:
    ASCII
    Binary/Image
    EBCDID
    Local

Data Transfer modes:
    Stream: sent as continuos leaving processing done by tcp
    Block: blocks -> block leader, byte count, data
    Compressed: data is compressed unsing a simple algorithm

FTP over SSH:
    difficult because FTP operates over multiple channels, tunneling will only protect main channel. encrypts commands and channel

TFTP:
    lock-step implementation

FTP commands are Telnet strings terminated by the Telnet end of line code. The command codes themselves are alphabetic character strings terminated by the character <Space> if parameters follow and <CRLF> otherwise.
